# Coronavirus
Tackling the covid-19 pandemic with AI.

## Getting Started

Make a new directory called `data` in the root and download the `level5_1000.csv` dataset into it from the dropbox.

Then make an virtual environment (make sure you are using python 3.7 or above) and activate it.
```
> python3 -m venv env
> source ./env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies into your virtual environment.
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start a jupyter session.
```
> jupyter notebook
(or alternatively)
> jupyter lab
```

Run a notebook in the `notebooks` directory.
